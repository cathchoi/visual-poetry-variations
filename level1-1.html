    <p>Hearts Like WildFlowers by Nikita Gill<br>
   
    I hope you are blessed with a heart like a wildflower.
           <br> Strong enough to rise again, 
           <br> after being trampled upon tough enough to weather the worst of summer storms, 
           <br> and able to grow and flourish even in the most broken places.</p>
